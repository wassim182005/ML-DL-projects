### 📝 Remarque

> **Note:** Apparently, this version of the code is not fully optimized. I managed to achieve **4th place** with this script, but there is definitely room for improvement. If you can enhance the performance or optimize the logic further, please do so! Thanks a lot.

**Would you like me to help you brainstorm some specific optimizations, such as hyperparameter tuning or ensemble methods, to help bridge the gap to 1st place?**
